# SENG401-Huddle-Project
Huddle (Sports Social Networking &amp; Forum Platform) 

Our team designed and implemented a hub for all things hockey. Huddle is a sports-focused discussion forum platform that allows its users to closely follow their 
favorite hockey teams, as well as read and post about different teams in the league. 
Users are also able to keep track of games through schedules of upcoming matches, look up player statistics and overall team standings.

To run the website, database, and generate api you must first install XAMPP 8.1.12-0. 
Within XAMPP you must have the following servers running: MySQL Database, ProFTPD, and Apache Web Server. 
Then you must import a zip file called SENG401-Huddle-Project containing all the .php, .sql, .js, .css, jest test, and phpunit files into your XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs folder.

You must also initialise the database in phpmyadmin. 
To do this you must type http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ into your web browser and import our huddledatabase.sql file.
